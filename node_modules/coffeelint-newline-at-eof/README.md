> Validate a newline policy at the end of each file

## Description

This [CoffeeLint](http://www.coffeelint.org) plugin verifies whether or not your files end with a newline. You can customise its behaviour to either enforce newlines at the end of each file or to prohibit them.

## Installation

```sh
[sudo] npm install -g coffeelint-newline-at-eof
```
> ***Note:*** *Right now a Coffeelint plugin cannot be installed as a project dependency and must be installed globally. Perhaps this will be improved in a future version of Coffeelint. If you would like to track progress on this enhancement head [over here](https://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/issues/210).*

## Usage

Insert the below configuration into *coffeelint.json* that you use for linting your scripts:

```js
"newline_at_eof": {
    "module": "coffeelint-newline-at-eof",
    "level": "error",
    "behaviour": "require"
}
```

## Configuration

The only configuration option specific to this plugin is the **behaviour** property.

Available values are:

 - **require** - Newlines are **required** to be present at the end of file
 - **forbid** - Newlines are **forbidden** to be present at the end of file

By default, Coffeelint will report errors if this rule is not satisfied. You may want to relax this by setting the **level** to **warn** in your configuration.

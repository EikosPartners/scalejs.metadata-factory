Thanks for your interest in making this project better! Here are a few things to keep in mind when sending pull requests.

## Base branch for pull requests

All work is done on the `develop` branch - base your topic branch on it. The `master` branch only used for releases and should never get ahead of `develop`.

## Coding style

[CoffeeLint](coffeelint.org) is used to validate coding style. Some styles are not currently defined in CoffeeLint so please keep the following in mind as well:

1. Function arguments must be always spaced on all sides - Not OK: `myFunc(arg1, arg2);`, **OK:** `myFunc( arg1, arg2 );`
1. Whitespace at the end of line is not allowed, even on empty lines

## Tests

Tests are very important! If you are adding or changing functionality or patching a bug, always provide tests which:

1. Fail without your code
1. Pass with your code

Doing so will prevent re-introducing an already fixed bug or breaking your functionality with some future change.

Happy forking!
